      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Inspired by Bob Ross, Dwarf Fortresses' world generation, and the CPU-only landscape generation program World Machine.}
		\item {Uses Unreal Engine 4's blueprint system for non-destructive node based generation.}
		\item {Uses GPU compute to highly parallelize generation and reduce computation time by orders of magnitude compared to CPU-only generation. Generation that would take over an hour on the CPU only takes a few minutes on the GPU.}
		%\item {Currently in progress. I hope to finish this project and publish it before summer 2018.}

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
	  	\item {Created a multiplayer space station simulation game based on the game Space Station 13.}
		\item {Used the game engine Unreal Engine 4.}
		\item {Integrated the OpenCL and OTL libraries with Unreal Engine for the project. Used OpenCL for the atmospheric simulation and MySQL with the OTL library for storing player data and committing database transactions.}
		\item {Used Marvelous Designer for the player clothes.}
		\item {The project was overly ambitious and while it was ultimately unsuccesful, working on the project non-stop after graduating from high school in the Summer of 2015 was one of the most insightful software engineering experiences I've had.}
